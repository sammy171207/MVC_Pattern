The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern divides an application into three components:

1. **Model**: Manages data and business logic.
2. **View**: Displays the user interface.
3. **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the Model and View.

It promotes clean, organized code by separating concerns: data, presentation, and user interaction.
